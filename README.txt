This project was created to fulfill Directed Independent Research requirements for WWU Spring Quarter 2020. 
The project members include Lukas McIntosh (author of repository) and Dr. Caroline Hardin (supervisor of DIR section). 

The motivation for the Hackathon research is to analyze and understand why some hackathons have a longer post-hackathon developement period.
It also serves to provide a useful software tool for Hackathon organizers to use to gain insights into their own hackathons.

Technical information:
In order to maintain a somewhat realistic time period of developement, only hackathons from the beginning of and to the end of 2019 will be considered.
Furthermore, only hackathons that use a GitHub or GitLab for a working repository will be considered in the project analytics. 
All of the hackathons used are found at mlh.io/seasons/na-2019/events. All of the GitHub/GitLab links are pulled from Devpost.com.

This project consists of web scripting, data analysis, statistics, and formal literature review.
