-	Notes for meeting with Hardin about 2nd web script (mlh hackathon names --> devpost)
-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


----> [email\xa0protected] scraping problem with BeautifulSoup
	--> Current implementation of script disregards and hackathon with the event-name variable equal to something of the form:
		a. string@string
		b. Hack@ The House!
		c. "Hack@CEWIT" vs "Hack @ CEWIT" (which actually made the list
	--> for 2019 and 2018 hacks was 339, now is 337

----> How to accurately and consistently navigate to corresponding devpost site
	--> Cant simply put in name like "byteHacks2018.devpost.com/submissions
		a. doesn't work for all hackathons
		b. Some hackathon titles begin with year, then name. Some hackathons don't include years at all in their event name
		c. How to query devpost to get the top result guaranteed to be the hackathon from mlh.io list
	--> If we solve this, then the script is done. It is just a matter of plugging it up and saving github links


-----> Next step, I am working on grabbing the github/gitlab link from an individual page example which should be the same for other page formattings
	--> Have developed a script that reliably grabs submission URLs from given Devpost Hackathon page





DELIVERABLE ADVICE:

-charts only, little data analysis

-better option: begin writing a paper
	a) methods- describe what you dide, how you did it, ect
	b) results- Say what you found and where you found it and this is what I found
	
-Better Better option: Literature review
	a) Textualize what I was doing fo this project, disucss Dr, Hardin's dissertation, provide analysis and discussion of ideas preseted in results section.
	b) Formal research paper (probably not a realistic goal)
